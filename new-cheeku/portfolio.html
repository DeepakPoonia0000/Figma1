                    <div class="pgraph1">Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix kernel.
                         It was created by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds in 1991, who wanted
                          to make a free and better version of Unix for his personal computer. He 
                          released the source code of Linux on the internet and invited 
                          other programmers to join him in developing and improving it. 
                          Since then, Linux has grown into a huge and diverse community of 
                          developers and users, who contribute to various versions or distributions of Linux,
                         such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Debian, and many more. Linux is popular among tech 
                         enthusiasts, programmers, hackers, and anyone who loves freedom and customization. 
                         Linux is also widely used in servers, supercomputers, embedded devices, and 
                         smartphones. You can run Linux on almost any hardware, from a Raspberry Pi to 
                         a NASA rover. Linux is also known for its stability, security, and performance. 
                         It rarely crashes, gets infected by viruses, or slows down over time.

                        Unix is an older operating system that was developed by AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s.
                         It was designed to be a portable, multi-user, and multi-tasking system that could 
                         run on different types of machines. Unix was also the first operating system to 
                         use a graphical user interface (GUI), which made it easier to interact with the 
                         computer using a mouse and windows. Unix was revolutionary for its time, and 
                         influenced many other operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
                         Unix is still used today, mainly in academic, scientific, and industrial settings. 
                         Some of the most common variants of Unix are BSD, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX. Unix is 
                         also the basis of iOS and Android, the operating systems that power most of the 
                         smartphones in the world.

                        Django 5.0, the latest version of the popular web framework, was officially 
                        released on December 4, 2023. This significant update brings a host of new 
                        features, improvements, and optimizations, making it a substantial leap 
                        forward from its predecessor, Django 4.2. The release is tailored to enhance 
                        the efficiency and capability of web development, offering developers more 
                        tools and functionalities to build robust web applications.

                        I believe that the conventional idea of “writing a program” is headed for 
                        extinction, and indeed, for all but very specialized applications, most 
                        software, as we know it, will be replaced by AI systems that are trained 
                        rather than programmed. In situations where one needs a “simple” program 
                        (after all, not everything should require a model of hundreds of billions 
                        of parameters running on a cluster of GPUs), those programs will, themselves, 
                        be generated by an AI rather than coded by hand.
                        I don't think this idea is crazy. No doubt the earliest pioneers of Computer 
                        Science, emerging from the (relatively) primitive cave of Electrical Engineering, 
                        stridently believed that all future Computer Scientists would need to command a deep 
                        understanding of semiconductors, binary arithmetic, and microprocessor design to 
                        understand software. Fast forward to today, and I am willing to bet good money 
                        that 99% of people who are writing software have almost no clue how a CPU actually 
                        works, let alone the physics underlying transistor design. By extension, I believe 
                        the Computer Scientists of the future will be so far removed from the classic 
                        definitions of “software” that they would be hard-pressed to reverse a linked list 
                        or implement Quicksort. (Hell, I'm not sure I remember how to implement Quicksort 
                        myself.)
                        AI coding assistants like CoPilot are only scratching the surface of what I'm talking 
                        about. It seems totally obvious to me that of course all programs in the future will 
                        ultimately be written by AIs, with humans relegated to, at best, a supervisory role. 
                        Anyone who doubts this prediction need only look at the very rapid progress being made 
                        in other aspects of AI content generation, like image generation. The difference in 
                        quality and complexity between DALL-E v1 and DALL-E v2 — announced only 15 months 
                        later — is staggering. If I have learned anything over the last few years working in AI, 
                        it is that it is very easy to underestimate the power of increasingly large AI models. 
                        Things that seemed like science fiction only a few months ago are rapidly becoming reality.
